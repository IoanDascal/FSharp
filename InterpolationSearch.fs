        Interpolation Search
    Given a sorted array of n uniformly distributed values arr[], 
write a function to search for a particular element x in the array.
Linear Search finds the element in O(n) time, Jump Search takes O(âˆš n) 
time and Binary Search take O(Log n) time.
    The Interpolation Search is an improvement over Binary Search for 
instances, where the values in a sorted array are uniformly distributed. 
Binary Search always goes to the middle element to check. On the other hand, 
interpolation search may go to different locations according to the value of 
the key being searched. For example, if the value of the key is closer to 
the last element, interpolation search is likely to start search toward the
end side.
