FSharp tests and projects
I'am learning F# and how to use Git.
  
     File A_List_Of_Applications.txt contains a list of all applications in F#, 
indicating their domain of applicability. 
     Files nrVarXXX.txt are just input files for applications with general name: varXXsubIII_pY.fs.
For example nrVar134.txt is the input file for var13subIII_p4.fs.
